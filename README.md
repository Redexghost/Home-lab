Active Directory Management: creating , manage, and maintain user accounts, groups, and 
organizational units (OUs).
Group Policy Management: I have created and applied Group Policies, 
which control user and computer settings in the network.
User Access control: Applied user permissions and access controls, 
ensuring the right level of access for each user or group to maintain 
security and compliance.
Networking: configured NAT so clients on the private network can reach the 
internet through the domain controller. I also set up the DHCP so clients 
can automatically receive an IP address.
Scripting and Automation: I used a script to automatically add 1000 users.
